This folder contains the experiment codes. Participants are generally asked to finish up to four sessions: two single face sessions and two ensemble perception sessions.

***IB_Phase1.m*** is the practice phase designed to familiarize the observers with the experimental stimuli (which look strange!) and the experimental protocol. 

By running ***Parameters_Input.m***, experimenters can manually input the location numbers designated uniquely to each subject using a GUI interface.
