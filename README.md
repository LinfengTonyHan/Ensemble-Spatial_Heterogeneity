# Ensemble-Spatial_Heterogeneity

This repository contains the project codes for the study **Ensemble Perception and Spatial Heterogeneity**. This project is led by Dr. Allison Yamanashi Leib and Dr. David Whitney at the University of California, Berkeley. The project codes in this repository are written by Linfeng Han.

For any questions or comments, please contact Linfeng Han (Tony): linfenghan98@gmail.com.

The ***Experiment_Programs*** folder contains the experiment scripts (written in Psychtoolbox). The  ***Data_Analysis*** folder contains the data analysis and visualization codes. We used the **Palamedes Toolbox (Prins & Kingdom, 2018)** to achieve the simulation of psychometric parameters.

For more details, please enter each folder separately. More details can be seen in the **README.md** files in each folder.
